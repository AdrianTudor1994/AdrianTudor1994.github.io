			<h2 class="nametitle">Adrian Tudor</h2>

			Hi there! My name is Adrian Tudor. I was born and raised in Romania for 12 years. I moved to the United States in 6th grade. My dad came here with a suitcase of clothes and $100 to begin a new life. Two years later we moved here without speaking a word of english and had to start off from zero. Not only did I learn english and spanish, but I was fortunate enough to discover myself and  my artisitc talents.
